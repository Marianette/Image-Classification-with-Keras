Summary:
  The penultimate goal of a CNN is for its layers to connect in such a way that the model learns features through convolution, introduces non-linearity through activation functions, reduces dimensionality (while preserving partial invariance) through pooling, produces high-level features, and then uses dense layers to return an imageâ€™s likelihood (probability) of belonging to a particular class.

Outcome:


  If you're reading this, please be aware that credit for the creation of the original assignment, a portion of the base code, and the training/testing datasets is given to Victoria University of Wellington (VUW). 
  
The goal of this assignment was to:

  - Produce a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that distinguishes between digital images of: cherrys, strawberrys, and tomatoes with a degree of accuracy which surpasses random guessing (roughly 33% acc).
  
  - Gain a deeper understanding of the development process for CNNs, including layers for: 
          - Convolution 
          - Pooling 
          - Dropout 
          - Fully-connected (Dense/MLP)
          - Activation, and 
          - Normalization
